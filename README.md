⚖️ Lawgic Bytes | The Interactive Legal Hub (v2.6)

Visualizing the future of Indian Law through software logic.

Lawgic Bytes is a high-performance interactive ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between static legal statutes and digital intelligence. Built for the 2026 legal landscape, this hub serves as a central protocol for navigating the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and other major Indian Acts through visual, automated logic.

💠 The Lawgic Experience

This is not a standard website; it is an interactive legal brain featuring:

Flagship BNSS Roadmap: A 7-phase digital journey from the crime scene (The Arena) to the final resolution. Experience the transition from paper-based CrPC to digital-first BNSS.

Lawgic Strike Engine: An interactive wisdom module. Click the legal quotes to trigger a UI Shake and emit digital logic particles across the screen.

Developer HUD: A real-time command center tracking system load and kernel authorization, providing a high-level technical overview of the hub's state.
